# About
* What is this repo?
> This is a slightly modified fork which includes some extra features & memes added to my liking.
* How's this different from the main repo?
> * Since the `list` module in the main repo doesn't have recursive search support, I integrated **SearchX-bot**'s search module into this. You can now search for files/folders in more than one drive.  
> **Note**: I did **not** integrate the main repo's **Shortener** feature to the search module, since I personally don't like shortened links in my search results.  

>* Apart from the search module, I also integrated my RSS feed parser module, **rss-chan**. You'll never be late to your mirroring schedules now. You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/hyPnOtICDo0g/rss-chan).

* What're those extra features?
>  * Added support to the `/mirror` command to automatically detect an URL when replied to a certain message. Magnet, Torrent, Mega & Direct links are supported.

> * I've made some improvements to the search module, such as:  
>   * Search filter to display (only) folders/files. Folders have been set as the default filter. Files can be searched by appending `-f` to a search query.
>   * Time taken to fetch the results
>   * Number of results found
